# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This is a project showing Louise's different campaign fares in relation with the date created and funded goals, using the overall campaign outcome results.

### Purpose
We mainly want to know the relation between the 'theater' category and overall outcomes based on their launch date. Also, the relation between the 'plays' category and overall outcomes based on their funded goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The screenshot of a pivot table showing the date launched/created, using just the month and its outcomes of ones which were successful, failed and canceled respectively. This table shows an almost constant theater failure rate. It also shows a very high rate of success in theater campaign towards the middle of the year with the highest success rate in the month of May but a very low success rate toward the end of the year,specifically in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The screenshot of a table showing the specific numbers of successful, failed and canceled outcomes recorded in 'plays' category in relation to a given goal range. This table simply shows a sharp decline in the total number of projects as the goals made were increased, with no recorded cancelation on any play campaign.The percentage outcomes, on the other hand, were fluctuating irrespective of the goals made.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The major challenge I faced was the getting the general 'countifs' fomular right, which I ended up solving individually.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. High success rate was recorded towards the middle of the year for the theater category, which might be evidence that people prefer going for that category around that time/season although the reason for that was not shown. Louise can decide to focus more energy on the theater campaign only towards the middle of the year.
2. The almost constant nature of the failure rate can also show that irrespective of a high or low success rate, the failure rate remains almost the same, therefore, Louise should rather focus on the success rate records which was high towards the middle year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The percentage success and failure rate has no relationship with the goals range recorded. Also the total number of recorded project where been generally reduced over time.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitation of this dataset includes exclusion some of data points from the tables in the analysis, That is, some infromation should have been included in the outcome tables for a more detailed analysis e.g country, deadline e.t.c.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 A table/ chart showing the goals, amount pleged and the deadline given to them to be able to know how it affected the success and failure rate and not just the goal range. Also, using country and backers count to know how many people were willing to contribute/pledge for the theater campaign instead of concluding based on the season/month of the year.
